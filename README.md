Small, currently very early Reinforcement Learning Starcraft 2 A.I - not in development

Unfortunately, I got stuck on the documentation side of things because I couldn't find a way to dynamically tell the AI where it can move to, what to select, etc.
If I ever figure out how to do those things, I am definitely carrying on with this project.
